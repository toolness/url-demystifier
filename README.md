This is a simple tool designed to help people understand what URLs are,
as well as providing gateways to learning about the structure of the
internet and various other Web literacy topics. It is also useful for
webmakers, as an easy-to-use substitute for certain aspects of tools like
[curl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL).

This prototype uses the [freegeoip.net](http://freegeoip.net/) service
for GeoIP lookup, and [head-cors-api][] for obtaining TLS and HTTP
header information.
